# Magik SDK
## Introduction
We are the Tech Tigers, and as a part of our FLL innovation project, we built the Magic Carpet and an SDK along with it.

### Product Overview
The Problem: There are not many fun ways to stay physically active at home

Our Solution: The Magic Carpet is an interactive carpet that is easy to use, needs no setup, fits in with your home decor, and offers an endless variety of games and exercises for all ages. It consists of
- A controller: [ESP32](https://amzn.to/38eJIx1) 
- The pressure sensing layer: [Velostat](https://amzn.to/3ehWQFK) and [copper tape](https://amzn.to/2OwDvWw)
- The LED layer: [LED strips](https://amzn.to/2O1q0OL)
- The cushion layer: [Interlocking, wood-patterned foam tiles](https://amzn.to/3rqJL0x)
- The facade layer: [Flex foam](https://bit.ly/38ioNcI)

### Motivation
During the pandemic, it's not safe to test our prototype with people in person. We made an SDK so that anyone can easily create games
- Without understanding the hardware
- Remotely without access to the hardware
- And keep things interesting with more and more games
