# Magik SDK

_SDK that will allow you to write a game for the [Tech Tigers](https://www.techtigers.team/home Magic Carpet game mat._
## Introduction
This was developed by the Tech Tigers FLL team as part of the Innovation Project for the 2020-2021 season -  Replay. As part of our competiton we had identify and popose an innovative solution. We chose the problem of there not being enough fun ways to stay active at home.

Our solution is the Magik Carpet - an interactive carpet that is easy to use, needs no setup, fits in with your home decor, and offers an endless variety of games and exercises for all ages.

It consists of:
- A controller: [ESP32](https://amzn.to/38eJIx1)
- The pressure sensing layer: [Velostat](https://amzn.to/3ehWQFK) and [copper tape](https://amzn.to/2OwDvWw)
- The LED layer: [LED strips](https://amzn.to/2O1q0OL)
- The cushion layer: [Interlocking, wood-patterned foamtiles](https://amzn.to/3rqJL0x)
- The facade layer: [Flex foam](https://bit.ly/38ioNcI)

### Motivation
During the pandemic, it was not safe to test our prototype with people
in person. We made an SDK so that:
- Less expirienced programmers on the team could still write games
- Teammates could write games without understanding or having acces to the hardware
- We could keep things interesting with more and more games
